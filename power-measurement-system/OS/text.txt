To enjoy all the benefits of the power tools and avoid
unnecessary complications, use a Linux distribution
for x86 with the kernel 2.6.32. The server in HLRS
uses "Scientific Linux release 6.6 (Carbon)" with the
kernel 2.6.32-431. The kernel must be patched with
Bigphysarea Patch. This is necessary to ensure that
you can uninterruptible  measure the power consumption
of the cluster components for several hours.
Consalt the instruction in readme_patch.txt to patch the kernel.
There will always be some variations in detail. For example,
the grub command line must be expanded with the parameter
bigphysarea=262144 in /boot/grub/grub.conf and not in
in /etc/lilo.conf. The number 262144 defined the number
of pages in the memory, which will be used by the
A/D converter APCIe-3021 to save the measure values
using DMA.
